# Kickstarter-Dapp

The kickstarter project consists on a crowdfounding web application that interacts with the ethereum blockchain, 
solving the problem where the contributors have no way to know how the money is used by the campaign creator. 
So, for a campaign manager to withdraw money from the campaign, he needs at least 50% positive votes from the contributors. 
Therefore, it allows the contributors to have more control or knowledge on how their investment is being used. 

Funcionality of the app: 
  1. Create a campaign (Manager) 
  2. Contribute (Contributors) 
  3. Create Request (Manager) 
  4. Approve Request (Contributors) 
  5. Finalize Request (Manager)
  6. View campaign information 
  
 For testing purposes:
  1. Mestamask plugin-in should be installed.
  2. Use Rinkeby ethereum Network.
